# **Movie Watch**

### **Overview**

This is one of the projects I did for my Android Nanodegree with Udacity.  It loads json data from a data
base API.  It loads data on popular and highly rated films and allows the user to add films to a favourites
data base powered by Room.  The app uses Picasso for loading images, and follows MVVM architecture with a repository,
view models and live data.  It also uses a broadcast receiver to detect when internet connectivity is established and
reloads data when that is the case.  I used constraint animation to create a morphing effect on the fab button in this app.

The URL for loading data has been removed in this version, but, if you're a Udacity student and want to try this app out,
go to the todo and insert the URL string where indicated.
